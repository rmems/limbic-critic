## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Pin Rust **1.98.1** in lockstep across `rust-version`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and CI/coverage workflows.
- Position the crate as a reward-shaping / modulator-mapping primitive (not a full actor–critic).

### Added

- `package.exclude` for CI/agent-only paths and a `cargo package` CI job.

### Fixed

- `TDCritic::new(alpha)` now returns `Result<TDCritic, InvalidAlpha>` and accepts only `alpha` in `(0, 1]`.

### Changed
