//! Neuromodulator concentrations produced by a critic.
//!
//! A [`ModulatorVector`] is the primary output of
//! [`SimpleCritic::assess`](crate::SimpleCritic::assess) and
//! [`TDCritic::assess`](crate::TDCritic::assess). Each field maps to a
//! classical neuromodulator role used for reward-modulated learning and
//! plasticity control in SNN systems.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use limbic_critic::ModulatorVector;
//!
//! let mods = ModulatorVector {
//!     dopamine: 0.8,
//!     serotonin: 0.2,
//!     acetylcholine: 0.1,
//!     norepinephrine: 0.0,
//! };
//! assert!(mods.dopamine >= 0.0);
//! ```
